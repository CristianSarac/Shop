        <h3>Impressing the impresionism current</h3>
        <p>
            After the Abstract Expressionists stretched the properties of 
            painting to their limits, countless waves of new movements responded 
            to and expanded their ideas. Artists such as Frank Stella and 
            Ellsworth Kelly continued to experiment with color, but moved 
            away from the concept of paint as the star of a work and toward 
            a less gestural, more “hard-edged” form, the artist uses hard colors 
            as a reply to impresionism.

        <h3>50 Shades of Grey</h3>
        <p>
            This piece of art is easy recognisable given it's "flooding" lines, which
            flow to the ends of the Earth, dranting dynamism. Embarking on the ideea
            that plastic art and architecture are eminently abstract, our artist manifests,
            with an eliberaring sensation, his whole emotional burden.

        <h3>Stirring the imaginative soul</h3>
        <p>
            Nowadays,in the 21st century, some instruments alike the computer, 
            were added to the inception of abstract art, thus leading to the 
            flourishment of digital art. This painting uses different figurative 
            elements, in order to create images and stimulate the spectators imagination. 
            It cannot be verbally defined. It creates a physical impression, bringing warmth, 
            or contrariwise, coldness in the eyes and soul of the observer.
